        <p>This beloved dish surely has its many redeeming qualities. But it is also surrounded by quite some controversy from its sauce to its history. Firstly, many recognize Carbonara immediately because of its white sauce. And so many assume that it was traditionally made with some milk or cream. But the original recipe actually mainly relies on eggs for that sauce. But with how much the dish has evolved over the years, many kinds of recipes for Carbonara also use cream, milk and cheese.</p>
        <p>As for where it came from, the history of Pasta Carbonara is quite debatable. But its origins can be traced back to a Neopolitan cookbook named “Cucina Teorico Pratica.” Ippolito Cavalcanti wrote this all the way back in the 1830s, and it shows us that the name “alla carbonara” means “coal-workers style.” And it is because of this that a great variety of origin theories revolve around coal miners creating the dish. </p>
